# 🎓 GradPlacifyr (Campus Placement Management System)

> A comprehensive, full-stack web application designed to streamline the campus placement process for Students, Training & Placement Officers (TPOs), and Company Recruiters.

---

## 📖 Description
GradPlacifyr is a centralized portal that bridges the gap between university administration, students, and hiring companies. It moves beyond a simple CRUD job board by integrating AI-driven profile building, an internal assessment engine with anti-cheating mechanisms, and robust role-based access control to ensure a transparent, fair, and efficient hiring drive.

## ❗ Problem Statement
The traditional college placement process is often fragmented, relying on spreadsheets, scattered emails, and manual tracking. 
* **For Students:** Difficult to track eligible companies, manage resumes, and prepare for specific roles.
* **For Colleges (TPOs):** Manual verification of student data, inability to seamlessly track off-campus offers, and lack of internal ranking to identify students needing help.
* **For Companies:** Sorting through unstandardized resumes and managing interview shortlists without a unified dashboard.

**GradPlacifyr solves this** by providing dedicated portals for each role, automating resume data extraction, and enforcing standardized communication.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Current Implementation
* **Frontend:** React.js, TypeScript (`.tsx`), Vite, Tailwind CSS (via PostCSS)
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (Relational data: Users, Jobs, Applications)
* **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

### Planned / Upcoming Integrations
* **Database Extension:** MongoDB (NoSQL) for unstructured data (AI Resume parsing JSONs, Test Logs).
* **AI Services:** Gemini 1.5 API (for Automated Resume Parsing and AI Prep Assistant).
* **Code Execution:** Judge0 API / Piston (for secure, sandboxed coding assessments).

## ⚙️ Requirements

### Functional Requirements
* **Student Portal:**
  * Auto-fill profile via AI Resume PDF Parsing.
  * One-click apply to eligible jobs based on CGPA and branch criteria.
  * Track application status and report external/off-campus offers.
  * Take college-assigned assessments (MCQs & Coding).
* **Company / Recruiter Portal:**
  * Self-registration and company profile management.
  * Post jobs with specific eligibility filters.
  * Review applicants, download resumes, and update hiring statuses.
* **Admin (TPO) Portal:**
  * Verify student and company registrations.
  * Create Assessment Drives to calculate an internal "Legitimacy Score".
  * Monitor real-time placement analytics and application flows.

### Non-Functional Requirements
* **Scalability:** System must handle concurrent assessment submissions (e.g., 500 students taking a test simultaneously).
* **Security:** Strict separation of data. Companies must *not* have access to the internal university "Legitimacy Score". Code execution must run in isolated sandboxes.
* **Integrity:** Anti-cheating mechanisms during assessments, including tab-switch detection and time-bound submissions.
* **Performance:** AI resume parsing must complete under 10 seconds.

## 🏛️ System Architecture & Design

### Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

*Maps the relational data structure across the three main domains: Users, Jobs, and Assessments.*

```mermaid
erDiagram
    USERS ||--o| STUDENT_PROFILE : has
    USERS ||--o| COMPANY_PROFILE : has
    USERS ||--o| ADMIN_PROFILE : has
    
    COMPANY_PROFILE ||--o{ JOB_POSTINGS : posts
    STUDENT_PROFILE ||--o{ APPLICATIONS : applies_to
    JOB_POSTINGS ||--o{ APPLICATIONS : receives
    
    ADMIN_PROFILE ||--o{ ASSESSMENTS : creates
    ASSESSMENTS ||--o{ QUESTIONS : contains
    STUDENT_PROFILE ||--o{ TEST_RESULTS : takes
    ASSESSMENTS ||--o{ TEST_RESULTS : generates
    
    STUDENT_PROFILE ||--o{ PLACEMENTS : secures

```

### Core Class Architecture (Domain Model)

*Demonstrates the Object-Oriented design, highlighting Inheritance (Users) and Polymorphism (Questions) for scalable feature expansion.*

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class User {
        <<Abstract>>
        #UUID id
        #String email
        #String passwordHash
        #Role role
        +login()
    }

    class Student {
        -String universityRegNo
        -double currentCgpa
        -String resumeUrl
        -int legitimacyScore
        +applyToJob()
    }

    class Company {
        -String companyName
        -String industry
        +postJob()
    }

    class Admin {
        +verifyUser()
        +createAssessment()
    }

    User <|-- Student
    User <|-- Company
    User <|-- Admin

    class Assessment {
        -UUID testId
        -String title
        +evaluateSubmission()
    }

    class Question {
        <<Abstract>>
        #String questionText
        +validateAnswer(input)*
    }

    class MCQQuestion {
        -Map options
        +validateAnswer(selectedKey)
    }

    class CodingQuestion {
        -List testCases
        +validateAnswer(submittedCode)
    }

    Assessment "1" o-- "1..*" Question : Aggregation
    Question <|-- MCQQuestion
    Question <|-- CodingQuestion
